        <p>Hello and welcome to my profile page.</p>
          
        <p>My name is Brian Wong. I was born in Seattle and went to school at the University of Washington.</p>

        <p>During my studies at the University of Washington, I worked as a library assistant assigned to the Music Library. I was a member of BITS (Business Information Technology Society) and the IMA Archery Club. My areas of concentration were Finance/Information System from the Michael G Foster Business School and Economics from the school of Arts and Sciences. I also took a course abroad in Shanghai, China to observe the rapid ascent of the modern Chinese economy.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include baseball, photography, commercial aviation, traveling. I am a support of the Seattle Mariners and have been attending games as a child since the Kingdome.</p>

        <p>My past work experiences have spanned customer service, retail sales, IT outsourcing, and project management.</p>

        <p>I've lived abroad in Beijing, China for several years in order to enhance my Mandarin skillsets and to have a personal viewpoint of the rapid development of the Chinese economy.</p>

        <p>Fun Fact: I've been to the tourist basecamp of Mount Everest in Tibet, the highest border crossing in the world at Khunjerab Pass (China-Pakistan border), and been atop the sand dunes of Mongolia at Khongoryn Els.</p>
